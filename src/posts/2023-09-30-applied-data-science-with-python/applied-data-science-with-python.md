<h4>Content</h4>

<ol>
    <li><b>Introduction</b> Introduction to the Python programming language. </li>
    <li><b>Jupyter Notebooks</b> Interactive reporting of results to colleagues and non-technicals with Jupyter Notebooks. New knowledge about data is not worth much if you aren't able to communicate the findings with your colleagues. Jupyter Notebooks is a strong tool for reporting.</li>
    <li><b>Data Import</b> Importing data from flat files and databases. Data comes from a variety of sources, it is therefore important to know how to get data into Python.</li>
    <li><b>Data Manipulation</b> Manipulating data in Python with a focus on the pandas package. The pandas package contains a user friendly API for data manipulation, this will help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.</li>
    <li><b>Data Visualization</b> Plotting data in Python with a focus on the matplotlib package. The matplotlib package contains a user friendly API for plotting in Python. To be able to plot is essential when new knowledge about data is to be shared with colleagues.</li>
    <li><b>Supervised Learning</b> Program a prediction model in Python, also called supervised learning. Learn how to implement models in Python through exercises, with a focus on the most popular Machine Learning models.</li>
    <li><b>Unsupervised Learning</b> Clustering Basics in Python, also called unsupervised learning. Learn how to group similar observations together.</li>
