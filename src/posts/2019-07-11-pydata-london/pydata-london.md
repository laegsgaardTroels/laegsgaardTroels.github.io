While working at Maersk I went to PyData 2019. I found two presentations very useful and I have used learnings from both in my day job. <!--more-->

## Testing for Data Science 

Testing for Data Science about the use of `pytest` and `unittest` for data science. Some of the topics were:

- Simple tests with `pytest`.
- Parameterized tests with `pytest`.
- Mocking with `unittest`, seems great for mocking a rest API.

See more in the repo from the talk in [1].

## Maintainable Code for Data Science

Maintainable Code for Data Science about the use of `scikit-learn` for data science. 

The presentation was useful because it showed some practical examples on how one can organize models using the `scikit-learn` framework. Some of the topics were:

- The `Transformer` and `Estimator` abstraction in `scikit-learn`.
- How to create custom versions of a `Transformer` and `Estimator`.
- An example of how to organize a Python module for model building.
