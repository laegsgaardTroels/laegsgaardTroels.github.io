I"ž<p>Random variables have an intuitive definition, but might not fully cover the intuitive concept of independence.  <!--more--></p>

<p>Assume a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$. Where the sample space is finite $\vert\Omega\vert=N$, the events are the powerset of $\Omega$ e.g. $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ and the probability is the discrete uniform distribution $\mathbb{P}(A)=\frac{\rvert A \rvert}{N}$.</p>

<p>This is how one can model a lottery. The fun thing is now when $N$ is a <strong>prime number</strong>.</p>

<p>Assume $A,B\in\mathcal{F}$ are two independent events, \(A,B\notin\{\Omega, \emptyset \}\), $m=\rvert A\rvert$, $k=\rvert B\rvert$, $n=\rvert A\cap B \rvert$ then</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{n}{N} = \mathbb{P}(A\cap B) &amp;= \mathbb{P}(A) \mathbb{P}(B) = \frac{m}{N}\frac{k}{N} \\
&amp;\Downarrow \\
n\cdot N &amp;= m \cdot k
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Let</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
n&amp;=\prod_{i}p^n_i \quad k=\prod_{i}p^k_i \\
m&amp;=\prod_{i}p^m_i
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Be their unique prime factorization. Then</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\prod_i p^n_i \cdot N = n\cdot N &amp;= m \cdot k = \prod_i p^m_i \prod_j p^k_j \\
&amp;\Downarrow \\
N \in \{p^m_1, p^m_2,&amp;\dots,p^k_1, p^m_2, \dots\}
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Because the prime factorization is unique.</p>

<p>But $\forall i,j:$ $p^m_i\leq m&lt;N$ and $p^k_j\leq k&lt;N$. This is a contradiction.</p>

<p>Hence if $N$ is a prime number and $A,B$ are independent then \(A,B\in\{\Omega, \emptyset \}\), <em>the trivial independent events</em>. But if $N$ is not a prime number then $N=k\cdot m$ for some integers, assume $k,m\geq 2$.
Let \(A=\{1,\dots,m\}\) and \(B=\{m,2m\dots,km\}\) implies</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{1}{m}, \quad \mathbb{P}(B) = \frac{1}{k}, \quad \mathbb{P}(A\cap B) = \frac{1}{N} = \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B)
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Many other <em>nontrivial pairs of events</em> can be constructed in similar ways.</p>

<p>Above is a rewritten proof and example from 2.15 in [1]. As state in this book this implies that when</p>

\[N=2^{127}-1=170141183460469231731687303715884105727\]

<p>A prime number. Then there are <strong>no</strong> nontrivial pairs of independent events, and if</p>

\[N=2^{127}=170141183460469231731687303715884105728\]

<p>Then there are lots of nontrivial pairs of independent events. This example does not imply that the definition of independence is wrong, but in my view that the mathematical definition of independence wrong, but it does seem unintuitive.</p>

<h2 id="example-a-dice">Example: A Dice</h2>

<p>A thought of mine. An example of above would be a single dice $X$ defined on $(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ where $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ and the probability is the discrete uniform distribution $\mathbb{P}(A)=\frac{\rvert A \rvert}{N}$ as above.</p>

<p>Now 6 is not a prime number. Its unique prime factorization is $6=2\cdot3$. Now each outcome can be mapped 1-1 with an index consisting of two random numbers $I\in{1,2}$ and $J\in{1,2,3}$ with uniform distribution e.g. $\mathbb{P}(I=i)=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\mathbb{P}(J=j)=\frac{1}{3}$ for $i=1,2$ and $j=1,2,3$.</p>

<p>As an example:</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
    I = 1, J = 1 \Rightarrow X = 1 \\
    I = 1, J = 2 \Rightarrow X = 2 \\
    I = 1, J = 3 \Rightarrow X = 3 \\
    I = 2, J = 1 \Rightarrow X = 4 \\
    I = 2, J = 2 \Rightarrow X = 5 \\
    I = 2, J = 6 \Rightarrow X = 6
\end{aligned}\]

<p>The mapping is not really that important in my view. What is interesting now is that $I$ has 2 outcomes and $J$ has 3 outcomes both <strong>prime</strong> therefore $\mathbb{P}_I$ and $\mathbb{P}_J$ has no independent events. In addition it can be seen that $I$ and $J$ are independent because $\mathbb{P}(I=i, J=j)=\frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3}=\mathbb{P}(I=i)\mathbb{P}(J=j)$ per construction.</p>

<p>So you can view a roll of this theoretical die as two independent outcomes from $I$ and $J$ that determines the index of the die.</p>
