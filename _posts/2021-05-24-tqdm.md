`tqdm` is a nice Python module for creating a progressbar when processing a list of items.<!--more-->

It can be used in a basic for loop:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

xs = [1, 2, 3]
ys = []
with tqdm(total=len(xs)) as pbar:
    for x in xs:
        ys.append(x ** 2)
        pbar.update()
```

And with `multiprocessing` as well:

```python
import multiprocessing
from tqdm import tqdm

def task(x):
     return x ** 2

pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=2)

xs = [1, 2, 3]
ys = []
with tqdm(total=len(xs)) as pbar:
    for y in pool.imap(task, xs):
        ys.append(y)
        pbar.update()
```
