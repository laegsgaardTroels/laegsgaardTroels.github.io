While working at Maersk I went to PyData 2019. I found two presentations very useful and I have used learnings from both in my day job. <!--more-->

## Testing for Data Science 

Testing for Data Science about the use of pytest for data science.

## Maintainable Code for Data Science

Maintainable Code for Data Science about the use of scikit-learn for data science. 

The presentation was useful because it showed some practical examples on how one can organize models using the scikit-learn framework.
